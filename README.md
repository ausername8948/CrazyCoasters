# **Crazy Coasters!**

### *Create the amusement park of your dreams!*

## Proposal!

### What will this application do?

- This application is a video game, similar to many of the idle games seen on the internet such as Cookie Clicker.
In this Amusement Park Simulator, you are the owner of your very own *amusement park*. 

- Players can build various rides,
do business, and expand their amusement park! Of course, money doesn't come so easily, and the happiness of the customers
must also be met. Don't forget to add amenities such as bathrooms and food stalls to meet the customer needs.

### Who will use this application?

- People who want to play a game that involves building their own amusement park!

### Why is this project of interest to me?

- I enjoyed playing idle games as a kid, and watching my wealth increase as the game progressed.
I also wanted to try building a game from scratch on my own. I think it will be quite enjoyable
to be able to customize and code an idle game.
